The position in the Piece class initialize, is inherited by all other pices subclasses.
Does this mean it will be overwritten when creating an instance of the subclass e.g. instance of Rook?
If Rook inherits from Pieces, we will have to pass in a symbol for colour - but there are two colours
We also need to pass in the board which stands for the grid on which it sets itself on to
And pos which are the coordonates where it the piece is set on the grid of the board INITIALLY

HOW DO WE INITIALIZE AN INSTANCE OF THE PIECES CLASS? AND DO WE NEED TO INITIALZIE TWO, ONE FOR EACH COLOUR?

If we initialize the pawns for the colour black and set them on the positions :
[0, 6],[1,6],[2,6],[3,6],4,6],[5,6],[6,6],[7,6] that means they can only move forward with +1 on the row which will result in [7,0][7,1] etc


moves
what do I need for a pawn to move?
- is it a valid move? 
    is it in the grid? true
    is it !empty? true 
        is it of oposite colour true
            put the piece of oposite colour in the player's bag
            return true
        end 
        return false 
    end


How do I check the colour of the piece vs the colour of the specific piece
is super.colour allowed?


In order for a piece to move we need:
 * its moves - done
 * the position to which to move:
    - we are getting the possition from the player as the input in the terminal or cursor?( how even to do that?) PLAYER
    - we are checkin the possition given from the list of that pieces available moves -BOARD/ GAME
    - we place the piece in the said position -BOARD
        - if it takes an opposite colour piece that piece disapears from the board into the current players potofolio -BOARD/GAME/PLAYER
    - we set the position where the piece was as :NullPiece -BOARD
    - we set the turn to the next player - GAME/PLAYER
