The position in the Piece class initialize, is inherited by all other pices subclasses.
Does this mean it will be overwritten when creating an instance of the subclass e.g. instance of Rook?
If Rook inherits from Pieces, we will have to pass in a symbol for colour - but there are two colours
We also need to pass in the board which stands for the grid on which it sets itself on to
And pos which are the coordonates where it the piece is set on the grid of the board INITIALLY

HOW DO WE INITIALIZE AN INSTANCE OF THE PIECES CLASS? AND DO WE NEED TO INITIALZIE TWO, ONE FOR EACH COLOUR?

If we initialize the pawns for the colour black and set them on the positions :
[0, 6],[1,6],[2,6],[3,6],4,6],[5,6],[6,6],[7,6] that means they can only move forward with +1 on the row which will result in [7,0][7,1] etc


moves
what do I need for a pawn to move?
- is it a valid move? 
    is it in the grid? true
    is it !empty? true 
        is it of oposite colour true
            put the piece of oposite colour in the player's bag
            return true
        end 
        return false 
    end
