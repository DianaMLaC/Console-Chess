Board:
    set the grid
    Placed the Pieces
    set the col, row as position given by the player -----the end_pos
    set the @grid[row][col] as position read by the computer ------the start_pos
    checked if a position is empty
    checks if a possition is valid ( in the grid)


Pieces
    Piece is initialized with position and colour
    Each piece inherits position and colour and has its own unique symbol
    Added available moves for pieces: Pawn, Rook (
        for which I have to find a solution for them not to overstep ocupied positions)
        I was thinking of doing this in the board, when it checks for available positions and slice from index 0 til position ocupied and only consider those
    

Game 
    keeps a hystory of moves for each piece as [Pice, colour, start_pos, end_pos] e.g. [:Kn, :white, [7,1], [5,2]]
